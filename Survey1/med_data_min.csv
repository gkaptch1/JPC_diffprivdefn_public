The debate on how ethical it is to use data and biospecimensâ€”collected primarily for clinical careâ€”for research purposes spans scientific, legal/ethical/regulatory, and patient circles. Many patients may not know how their data are being used for research. Some may receive a re-consent form, but this requirement can be waived by IRBs (institutional review boards) in certain circumstances. Consent is typically broad and binary (i.e., patients either consent or not), and tiered approaches to informed consent are seldom utilized. Innovative systems that inform patients about the current use of their data and allow them to select tiered opt-out options could offer an alternative to current practices. However, institutions may be hesitant to adopt such systems, since this might decrease participation in data sharing for research and potentially bias research results. The financial and political costs of implementing such systems, as well as their efficacy in terms of patient and provider satisfaction, are currently unknown. A recent survey indicates that many patients believe the use of electronic health records will improve care2. Technical obstacles also exist, as ways of ensuring compliance to patientsâ€™ choices may be difficult to implement and upkeep. The ethical gains in implementing choices for patients, however, may justify the development towards systems of granular control should continue",,,Yes,much greather,5 - Full Understanding,4,5 - Full Understanding,4,5 - Full Understanding,5 - Full Understanding,Man,1987,White,,Associate's degree,"I have an education in, or work in, the field of computer science, computer engineering or IT.","$50,000 to under $65,000",<li> <b>other doctors involved in the non-profit</b><u> will not</u> be able to learn your medical history. </li>,<li> <b>A criminal or foreign government</b> might learn your medical history.  <u>The chance this happens is <b>higher than</b> the chance that your bank account will be compromised</u> (accessed by a person who you did not intend to gain access to) as part of a breach in the next year. </li>,<li><b>Law enforcement</b> might access your medical record with a warrant.  <u>The chance this happens is <b>higher than</b> the chance that your bank account will be compromised </u> (accessed by a person who you did not intend to gain access to) as part of a breach in the next year. </li>,,,,,TRUE,I agree,"Whether other doctors involved in the non-profit could learn your medical history,Whether data analyst at the non-profit could see your medical record,Whether graphs and charts created by the non-profit could reveal your medical record,Whether your medical record could be shared with another organization",,No,,"I'm not inclined to do it anyway, since it won't directly benefit me.
